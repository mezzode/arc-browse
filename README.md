This extension adds a command to `arc browse` the current file, for quick access by users of [Phabricator](https://www.phacility.com/phabricator/) and [Arcanist](https://www.phacility.com/phabricator/arcanist/).

## Usage

Just call `Arcanist: Browse` from the command palette.

## Requirements

As this extension just calls `arc browse`, an appropriately configured install of [Arcanist](https://www.phacility.com/phabricator/arcanist/) and a repo configured to work with a [Phabricator](https://www.phacility.com/phabricator/) instance are required.

## Settings

`arc-browse.useRelative`: whether to `arc browse` using relative path to the file (from the workspace root) rather than absolute. Defaults to `true`.
